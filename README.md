# MoonShot
A collection of image-processing routines for developing lunar, solar, and planetary astrophotography.

The secondary purpose is to supplement existing dcraw and imagemagick functionality so astrophotography post-processing can be done from raw video or stills to a single final image, in an easy unix-style manner (i.e. a bash script executing a series of binaries to process the data step-by-step).

The primary purpose is to practice rolling my own image-processing algorithms and to get my feet wet in OpenCL.
